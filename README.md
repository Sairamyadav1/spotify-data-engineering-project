# Introduction

In this project, I have executed an End-To-End Data Engineering Project using Aws Cloud.

First Data will be Presented in the staging layer then we will be using AWS Glue to build our ETL pipeline and transfer into our Dataware house once our data is placed.
we will be running a glue crawler that will create a database and populate a table for our database then we will be using AWS Athena to query the data present in the table.
once everything is set we can connect to quick sight to visualize the data
